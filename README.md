# Welcome to Tomb's Snake Game!
![N|Solid](https://html5-games.io/data/image/snakelogo.png)

The more apple it eats, the bigger(longer) it gets, but it is going to die if you let it hit the border!

Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
It only can not move 180 degrees.

run `javac *.java ` to compile and run `java SnakeGame` to play the game!
